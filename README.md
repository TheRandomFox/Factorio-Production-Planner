# Factorio-Production-Planner
Author: Abdul Halim bin Slamat

Created as a school project, 300CEM AAD. A simple companion app for the PC game Factorio, to help you plan your production lines. 

Built for Android 8.0+

Calculates the number of assembling machines required to achieve a specified rate of production for the user's desired output product, the input demand rate, as well as the minimum number of machines required to adequately supply the necessary input demand to achieve the production goal.

Variable factors included:

	- base crafting time
	
	- speed modifiers for assembling machines (AM 1, 2, 3)
	
	- speed modifiers for furnaces (stone, steel, electric)
	
	- speed modifiers for Speed Modules (Speed 1, 2, 3)
	
	- belt speed (yellow, red, blue)
	
	- no. of output products per cycle

Due to lack of time, and the app being primarily a proof-of-concept for now, only the "Intermediate Products" (excluding nuclear techs) and some of the most commonly-used items in the "Logistics" tab will be implemented. Given more time, the app may be expanded to include the rest of the recipies in the game.

I can't get the Products object class to work and I don't know why.
